Next steps:

Generate list of candidate moves
(legal moves per piece)
(filter by off-board)
(filter by blocked)
(filter by moving into check -- or defer until elsewhere?)

What does a move list look like?
Could store moves per piece in which case only destination is needed
But maybe simpler to list src (rank,file) -> dest (rank,file)
Move type
Movelist type
